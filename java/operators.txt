< Less Than
>= Greater Than of Equal to
<= Less Than of Equal to
== Equality
!= Inequality

Prefix and Postfix Operators

--q // q = 3

Assignments Operators
Operators	Usage							Example
=		a = b, sets a to b					a = 17.0
+=		a += b increment a by b					a += 12
-=		a -= b decrements a by b				a -= 6
*=		a *= b mmultiplies a by b and stores it in a
/=		a /= b divides a by b and stores it in a
%=		a %= b divides a by b and stores the remainder in a

Logical Operators: Result in a boolean
a is true
b is false
&& - Logical And a && b is false
|| - Logical Or a || b is true
! - Logical Not !a is false, !b is true
